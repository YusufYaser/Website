# Welcome to My Blog

Hey there! I'm Yusuf Kelany and this is my first post on my blog. I plan to share my thoughts and experiences on various topics here.

## Who on Earth Are You?

I'm a software developer that's passionate about building and learning new stuff. I like problem solving and creating ~~(or breaking)~~ things from time to time.

## What to Expect from This Blog?

For the 2 people who are interested, I'll cover topics about stuff I've done such as:

- Game Development, including game engines
- Security Research
- Programming

_...that is if I'll post anything in the first place_
